I have not used any JavaScript libarary or framework, to show that how complecated your project 
will be without using JS lib/Framework.

In React js each component can have it is seperate file, and it will be very easy to find errors 
or anything specific you want to change in the project.

And I would like to also mention that React js has a lot of powerful UI libraries like MUI, Chakra UI, ETC.....
which can make your works easier to understand and more beautiful to look at.
